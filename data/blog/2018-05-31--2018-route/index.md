**Bike was stolen, plan has changed** Please read update [here](/blog/2018-07-24-walking-instead/)

So we can announce plan for 2018 trip. We organised [club on Strava](https://www.strava.com/clubs/cyclingdevs) with
details.

We decided to skip the train as it's impossible to book space for bikes (there is space for 2 bikes per whole train on GWR !!!).

Feel free to join on any part.

We still need to find cause to fundrise for.
