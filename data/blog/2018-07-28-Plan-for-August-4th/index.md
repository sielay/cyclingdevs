[Aug 4th](https://www.strava.com/routes/14502542) 26.8m.

First 14 miles to Folekstone will be flat and pleasant. Then I'd need proper
rest, refill and supply.

Next 6 miles will be climbing white clifs, to walk down to Dover at mile 20
and then climb again to St. Margaret's Cliffe and finish at the campsite.

Will try to stay at [Howthron Farm](https://www.campsites.co.uk/search/campsites-in-kent/dover/hawthorn-farm)
