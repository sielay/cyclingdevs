[Aug 2nd](https://www.strava.com/routes/14502404) 26.55m.

First 18 miles of the trip will be easy walk along the beach. Eastbourne will
be great place to buy some supply. On 12th mile Bexhill should be good for having
a proper meal.

Then in Hashtings we'd begin small cling to Hashtings Country Park and the uphill
walk to the land to find place for a tent near Westfield.

Staying at [Blackhurst Campsite - Sadlecombe](https://www.pitchup.com/campsites/England/South_East/East_Sussex/Sedlescombe/buckhurst-campsite/) &pound; 10.
